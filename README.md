### Aloha 👋

I'm a Mathematician and Computer Scientist, primarily interested in:

* Programming Languages - Specification and Implementation
* Software Verification, Correctness and Reliability
* Functional Programming and Theory of Computing
* Automated Reasoning
* Randomness
* Uncertainty Quantification

Outside computing, my interests are diverse and include scholarship (I enjoy studying other subjects such
as Economics, Biology, Chaos/Complexity, etc) and music (singing 🎤 / guitar 🎸 / piano 🎹)

### Work 👨🏻‍💻💸

I'm working as a *Software Engineer* at [GitHub](https://github.com/github), where I'm part of
the *Security Products Engineering* department, working on [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com)
and assorted tools.

Before that, I was part of [Diffblue](https://www.diffblue.com)'s *Open Source* team, where I spent my time
maintaining [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc), a *model checker for C* (a tool for verifying that the
behaviour of C code aligns with its specification).
