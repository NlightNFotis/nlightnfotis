### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer scientist, primarily interested on:

* Programming Languages - Specification and Implementation
* Software Verification, Correctness and Reliability
* Functional Programming and Theory of Computing
* Automated Reasoning

Outside of computing, I'm also very keen on music (I sing, play piano and guitar),
and had some brief stints of (commercial) modelling.
